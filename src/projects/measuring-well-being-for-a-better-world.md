      ## What Is Well-Being
       Well-being is an expansive concept associated with happiness, health, longevity, safety, social connectedness, productivity and fulfillment. It is comprised of two major spheres, objective and subjective.
      **Objective well-being** is comprised of things like the level of
      education, economic stability and sufficiency, the standard of living,
      safety from crime and war, health and life expectancy, social services and
      infrastructure.

      **Subjective well-being** is different in that it is based on an
      individuals subjective assessment of the quality of their life. This
      generally includes factors such as a sense that a person's life has
      meaning, that they are growing as individuals, that they are in control of
      their life, that they have community and feel happy or optimistic about
      the future. A person's experience of subjective well-being is informed by
      their culture and life experiences and so it is more difficult to measure
      across cultures and groups.

      ### How Can Measuring Well-Being Create a Better World

      If we can understand the building blocks of well-being, then we can create
      policies that target them, creating conditions where there are less
      obstructions to subjective well-being.

      By measuring well-being we can analyze the impact of different policies on
      well-being, observing trends in countries' historical well-being and
      compare them against other countries. Increasing quality of life should be
      a key focus for all governments and the more we attempt to measure and
      improve well-being, the more we will learn about how to measure and
      improve well-being.

      ### The History of Measuring Human Well-Being

      Global efforts to measure human well-being are still relatively new. After
      World War 2 and the Great Depression, whencountries were attempting to
      find ways to measure theirrecoveries, economist Simon Kuznets developed
      the concept of GrossDomestic Product (GDP) to capture all economic
      production byindividuals, companies and the government in a single
      statistic. Hetheorized that it should correlate to well-being since it
      would rise in good times and fall in bad.

      ## Beyond GDP, New Metrics for Measuring Well-Being


      GDP is relatively easy to measure and served as the primary measure of a
      country's well-being for many years. While economic growth and wealth is a
      vital component of well-being, it's too simplistic to capture the entirety
      of it.


      It is necessary to create multi-faceted metrics in order to better
      understand well-being, create policy that will improve it and avoid and
      reform policies that will degrade it.


      Several individuals and groups have developed metrics for measuring
      well-being. The differences between these metrics show what these
      individuals and groups consider to be most important for well-being. Most
      of these metrics focus on objective well-being because the data is more
      easily measured and modeled.


      Of the metrics analyzed here, **Happy Planet Index** and **World Happiness
      Report Score** are the only ones to measure subjective well-being.They
      take responses to the World Gallup Poll survey question that asks people
      to rank their happiness on a scale of zero to ten.The **HPI** is a
      composite of subjective well-being and objective well-being metrics while
      the **WHRS** is purely a measurement of subjective well-being.


      - **The GINI Index (GINI)** measures inequality in distribution of family
      income

      - **The Happy Planet Index (HPI)** measures a combination of well-being,
      health/life expectancy, inequality and ecologicaly footprint

      - **The Human Development Index (HDI)** measures health/life expectancy,
      standard of living, amount of education received

      - **The Sustainable Economic Development Assessment (SEDA)** focuses on
      Economic factors, Investments in Social Services like education, health
      and infrastructure and Sustainability.

      - **The World Happiness Report Score (WHRS)** measures people's
      experiences of the quality of their lives

      measures.*

      ### GINI Index


      One of the oldest measurements of wellbeing is The GINI index, developed
      by Italian Statistician Corrado Gini in 1912, measures inequality in
      income distribution in family income, with 0 representing perfect equality
      (everyone earns exactly the same) and 1 representing perfect inequality
      (one family earns everything, everyone else earns nothing).


      The GINI index is an imperfect measurement because it focuses on income,
      rather than wealth, which is much harder to measure because of unreliable
      GDP and income data. Shadow economies and tax havens make it hard to
      measure income and wealth, particularly in developing countries. Despite
      this, it appears to be fairly well

      correlated to GDP per capita, meaning that countries with a higher GDP per
      capita tend to have less inequality, at least as far as it is measured
      here.

      ### Happy Planet Index


      The Happy Planet Index was created by the New Economics Foundation, the
      UK's leading think tank promoting social, economic and environmental
      justice. They devised the Happy Planet Index in hopes of shaping the
      economies of the world to be better for people and the environment. The
      Happy Planet Index is calculated according to four key metrics,
      well-being, life expectancy, inequality and ecological footprint.


      [The exact methodology is broken down in their methods
      paper](http://happyplanetindex.org/s/Methods-paper_2016-48te.pdf)


      They claim that GDP growth as a central aim of governments has led to
      political conditions where politicians are more likely to try and deliver
      short term GDP growth to insure reelection. This type of strategy
      unfortunately has led to deteriorating social conditions, growing
      inequalities and an inability to deal with Climate Change. Western Nations
      are often regarded as having the highest GDP and standard of living but
      nations in Latin America and in the Asia Pacific region have the highest
      Happy Planet Index by achieving higher life expectancies, high well-being
      and a much lower ecological footprint.


      The Happy Planet Index aims to create an average view of well-being in a
      given country but it fails to account for some factors, such as Human
      Rights Violations. Human Rights Violations are typically only visited up
      minorities in a given country and so their experiences are likely to make
      a small effect on wellbeing in a nation when measured in this way.

      ### Human Development Index


      The Human Development Index was created by the United Nations Development
      Program in 1990 as a way to measure the potential of people across
      different countries according to three key dimensions, life expectancy,
      education and earning potential. The HDI is not meant to include all of
      the factors of human development and well-being, it is meant to stimulate
      debate around policy priorities pertaining to its three key dimensions.


      Their reasoning is that if a person's basic needs are met by living
      longer, having more education and earning more money, their quality of
      life should be better. In Norway, the country with the highest HDI, a
      child born today can expect to live at least 82 years and spend 18 years
      in school while a child born in Niger, the country with lowest HDI can
      expect to live to 60 and spend 5 years in school.


      Norway, Switzerland, Australia, Ireland and Germany lead the HDI ranking
      while Niger, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Chad and Burundi
      have the lowest scores in health, education and income. The biggest
      declines in HDI were countries in conflict, Syria, Yemen and Libya. The
      Human Development Index has been trending up globally, with more countries
      increasing life expectancy, education and development since the Index has
      started to be measured. Over the past five years, life expectancy has
      increased almost 7 years globally with Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia
      making the biggest gains.


      The Human Development Index shares a strong correlation with the
      Sustainable Development Assessment Index.

      ### Sustainable Economic Development Index


      The Sustainable Economic Development Index is a method for gaining insight
      into a countries social and economic conditions. SEDI is built on ten
      dimensions across three categories, Economics (Income, Economic Stability
      and Employment), Investments (Education, Health, Infrastructure) and
      Sustainability (Environment, Equality, Civil Society and Government
      Effectiveness).


      European countries make up the top 71% of SEDI scores in 2018, largely
      thanks to their high income levels and investments in social progress and
      governance. Singapore is the only non-European nation in the top ten.
      Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the UK and the US are the only
      G20 countries in the SEDA top 20.

      ### World Happiness Report Score


      The World Happiness Report uses data from the Gallup World Poll question
      focusing on life evaluation, called the Cantril ladder. In this question,
      respondents rate their lives on a scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the best
      possible life and 0 is the worst.


      The World Happiness Report then focuses its country scores on the feeling
      of happiness, which is a combination of the emotional and fulfillment
      aspects of happiness. This makes this measurement unique in that it is
      focused first and foremost on happiness.


      In recent releases of the Happiness Report, they have analyzed six
      factors, GDP, life expectancy, generosity, social support, freedom and
      corruption for each country to try to explain the answers to the Cantril
      Ladder. These factors aren't used in the creation of the scores in this
      report but show what the authors think of as important to human happiness
      and well-being and what might explain why some countries rank higher than
      others.

      ## Conclusion


      We are in the nascent stages of finding the best method for measuring
      well-being and even earlier in making policy decisions based on that data.
      As we begin to learn more about human well-being and how we can maximize
      it, we can learn how to create more human friendly systems and policies.


      On a community level, it's important to look at both objective and
      subjective measures of well-being when trying to address the issues we
      face.


      On a personal level, it's important to be more aware of what makes us
      happy and try to bring more of that out into our lives. Happiness is not
      just the opposite of negative emotions but a collection of various
      dimensions that can and should be cultivated.


      >The pursuit of happiness lies at the core of human endeavors. People
      around the world aspire to lead happy and fulfilling lives free from fear
      and want, and in harmony with nature,Yet, basic material wellbeing is
      still elusive for far too many living in extreme poverty.

      >

      >For many more, recurring socio-economic crises, violence and crime,
      environmental degradation and increasing threats of climate change are an
      ever-present threat. 

      >

      >Let us reinforce our commitment to inclusive and sustainable human
      development and renew our pledge to help others.When we contribute to the
      common good, we are enriched. Compassion promotes happiness and will help
      build the future we want.
