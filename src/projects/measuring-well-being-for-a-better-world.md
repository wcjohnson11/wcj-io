An interactive exploration on the history and current methods for measuring global well-being that was my entry into the World Data Visualization Prize.

This project was an opportunity to experiment with D3 and React.

## What Is Well-Being

 Well-being is an expansive concept associated with happiness, health, longevity, safety, social connectedness, productivity and fulfillment. It is comprised of two major spheres, objective and subjective.

**Objective well-being** is comprised of things like the level of education, economic stability and sufficiency, the standard of living, safety from crime and war, health and life expectancy, social services and infrastructure.

**Subjective well-being** is different in that it is based on an individuals subjective assessment of the quality of their life. This generally includes factors such as a sense that a person's life has meaning, that they are growing as individuals, that they are in control of their life, that they have community and feel happy or optimistic about the future. A person's experience of subjective well-being is informed by their culture and life experiences and so it is more difficult to measure across cultures and groups.

### How Can Measuring Well-Being Create a Better World

If we can understand the building blocks of well-being, then we can create policies that target them, creating conditions where there are less obstructions to subjective well-being.

By measuring well-being we can analyze the impact of different policies on well-being, observing trends in countries' historical well-being and compare them against other countries. Increasing quality of life should be a key focus for all governments and the more we attempt to measure and improve well-being, the more we will learn about how to measure and improve well-being.

### The History of Measuring Human Well-Being

Global efforts to measure human well-being are still relatively new. After World War 2 and the Great Depression, when
countries were attempting to find ways to measure their
recoveries, economist Simon Kuznets developed the concept of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) to capture all economic production by
individuals, companies and the government in a single statistic. He
theorized that it should correlate to well-being since it would rise in good times and fall in bad.


*The linechart below allows you to observe countries GDP per capita(adjusted for inflation and Purchasing Power Parity) over time since 1950. You can add or remove countries using the select bar to inspect specific countries' GDP.*

## Beyond GDP, New Metrics for Measuring Well-Being

**GDP** is relatively easy to measure and served as the primary measure of a country's well-being for many years. While economic growth and wealth is a vital component of well-being, it's too simplistic to capture the entirety of it.

It is necessary to create multi-faceted metrics in order to better understand well-being, create policy that will improve it and avoid and reform policies that will degrade it.

Several individuals and groups have developed metrics for measuring well-being. The differences between these metrics show what these individuals and groups consider to be most important for well-being. Most of these metrics focus on objective well-being because the data is more easily measured and modeled.

Of the metrics analyzed here, **Happy Planet Index** and **World Happiness Report Score** are the only ones to measure subjective well-being.They take responses to the World Gallup Poll survey question that asks people to rank their happiness on a scale of zero to 10.The **HPI** is a composite of subjective well-being and objective well-being metrics while the **WHRS** is purely a measurement of subjective well-being.

- **The GINI Index (GINI)** measures inequality in distribution of family income
- **The Happy Planet Index (HPI)** measures a combination of well-being, health/life expectancy, inequality and ecologicaly footprint
- **The Human Development Index (HDI)** measures health/life expectancy, standard of living, amount of education received
- **The Sustainable Economic Development Assessment (SEDA)** focuses on Economic factors, Investments in Social Services like education, health and infrastructure and Sustainability.
- **The World Happiness Report Score (WHRS)** measures people's experiences of the quality of their lives
